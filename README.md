# Fashion-Recommendation-System
This project recommends similar fashion items based on a user-uploaded image. It uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from the image and compares them with a dataset using Euclidean distance. The top 5 visually similar fashion items are then returned as recommendations.
