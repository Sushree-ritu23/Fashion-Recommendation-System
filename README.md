# ðŸ‘— Fashion Recommendation System
This project recommends similar fashion items based on a user-uploaded image. It uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from the image and compares them with a dataset using Euclidean distance. The top 5 visually similar fashion items are then returned as recommendations.

##  Project Overview

The Fashion Recommendation System is a deep learning-based project designed to suggest visually similar fashion items based on an uploaded image. By leveraging the power of ResNet50 for feature extraction and using Euclidean distance for similarity comparison, the system can identify and return the top 5 most similar fashion products from the dataset. This approach offers a more intuitive and image-driven shopping experience, eliminating the need for keyword-based searches.
